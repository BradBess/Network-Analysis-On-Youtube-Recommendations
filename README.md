# Network-analysis

Network-analysis consist of nodes and edges used in gephy to create a network analysis of youtube video's that are recommended based on 'PCR test betrouwbaar' as seen on 'Zondag met Lubach'.
The video can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLoR2Spftwg.

Futher analysis of the network can provide inside in potential clusters of conspiracy theory video's. Are they clustered together? That would prove a proof of the theory as seen in the video from Arjan Lubach. 
Yet this network is only used as a starting point to get experience with network analysis and gephy.
